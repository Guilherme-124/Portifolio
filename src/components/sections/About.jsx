          I took one course in Java and worked on some personal projects using Python and JavaScript,
          but my real journey into programming began when I enrolled in the CS50 course. Before that,
          I had a solid understanding of programming languages, but when it came to creating programs
          or websites, I often struggled with knowing where to start. Some problems felt overwhelming.
          At that time, I wasn't accustomed to using pseudocode to break down functions into smaller
          and more manageable parts, which made tackling problems much easier. Although Iâ€™ve improved
          since then, I still occasionally find myself relying on a text file to organize my thoughts.
